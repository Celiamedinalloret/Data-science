### Abstract

This study analyses the state of data science and AI in Spanish language. The motivation is driven by our previous project: https://doi.org/10.21428/39829d0b.d871fa5c - “The art of Artificial Intelligence from a lexical perspective”. The search for information about AI in Spanish language was a failure, so it must rely on English language. This study is divided into two interlinked parts: the first one exposes what data science is, the benefits produced, and the education that a data scientist should have. Therefore, a relation of data science and AI with Spanish language. Questions are raised about how the training of data scientist in Spain is, and the analysis of diagrams, which shows the percentage of Spanish and English academic articles. Moreover, there are many contributions of members and representatives of Latin American Languages Academies. They comment on the lack of AI glossary written in Spanish language. The study of art provides results that indicate the absence of involvement of Spanish with AI and all the subareas, which consequently adversely affect to the education of future professionals. Key words: AI, data science, Spanish language and education.

Key words: AI, data science, Spanish language and education. 

### Introduction
### What is known?
“The idea that all change should be sweet, slow and stable does not sprout from rocks. It represented a common cultural bias, that is, an answer from the liberalism of nineteenth century for a world in revolution […].” Those words were used by the palaeontologist Stephen J. Gould to describe the term “gradualism”. This concept directly addresses the revolution of planet because of the development of TICs and the progress of new educational areas as artificial intelligence (Manuel Castell, 1999, p.1). Generally, when we refer to AI, a significant percentage of population has a wrong idea of what it is because AI is not refer to machines that do the tedious work which human being does not carry out. Artificial intelligence is much more (IT Digital Media Group, 2017). There are many branches of knowledge in AI that help us daily, for instance, data science enables us to identify the hidden relationships between variables with the aim of stablishing and creating different versions and predictive classifications (R.A. Salas Rueda, 2019) (R.D. Salas Rueda, 2019). For more information, see also the next example. The acronym “MENA” is used in Spain to denominate unaccompanied foreign minors (BBC News, 2019). However, thanks to data mining technique (an area of data science), it has been found that: “This abbreviature evokes a concerned, criminalized and moralist discourse from an adult centric and nationalist perspective (Scientific journal of Comunication and Education: Comunicar, 2021).

### A bit of history
In last years, the term data science has achieved a considerable prestige in world. In 1962, people was already talking of it, when the American statistical, John W. Tukey, started to awake his interest in the future of mathematic statistic as experimental science. His contributions were focused on studying different techniques of data analyses. Some time later, his proposal rose to such heights that he published the book: “Exploratory Data Analyses” (EDA, Exploratory Data Analyses) (Turkey et al., 1977).
 
### What is the purpose?
This project tends to photograph instantly state of the art of data science in artificial intelligence. The analysis is applied in several areas of study, but without losing sight of our objective: education. Nowadays, the diffusion of the English language has become in a globalised process. Thus, English language is considered a language of international communication or lingua franca (Graddol, 1997 y 2006). Globalisation is the responsible for the fragility of other languages and, specifically, Spanish language (Joaquín Guerrero, 2010). Spanish is an orphan language in terminology, use, and vocabulary to be used in AI. This adversely affects on the exploration of new techniques applied to different fields of study. That also means a precariousness in notable areas as education and, concretely, in universities.

### Development
### Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
For some time now, classic disciplines such as statistics and distributed systems have been pushed into the background in the presence of propulsion of a new and important doctrine: data science (Wil van der Aalst, 2016). Before continuing, the extension of definition of data science and its application in AI included in the introduction of this project, it should be highlighted. In 2015, the doctor Alex Liu, a pioneer data scientist, and, most importantly, very experimented in this area, he redacted a definition of data science in a publication in IBM Corporation: “Data science is an interdisciplinary field about processes and systems to gain knowledge or perspectives of large data volumes in many ways. They could be structured or not structured, what implies the continuation of some of data analyses fields such as data mining and predictive analyses, as well as the discover of knowledge and data mining.”

In 2018, José Luis Marín, head of corporative Technology Strategy, published an article about data science, the branches that composed it and the function developed by certain specialities. Machine Learning and Deep Learning, they constitute two fields of knowledge of artificial intelligence which are of fundamental importance for data science, bearing in mind that they combine with other technologies such as: Natural Language Processing (NLP), visualization of data and experimental design. In addition, the description that he includes about the labour that Machine Learning and Deep Learning execute in this doctrine: “Both look for the composition of systems of orthographical prediction or automatic translation, autonomic cars or applied and artificial vision systems in uses cases as spectacular as the shops of AmazonGo.”

### Data Science: a practical approach
To be certain about the application of data science in real world, this part of the project is oriented to do a basic exploration of  state of the art of data science. To carry out this undertaking, it is evaluated the sector of tourism, an area related to society, economy, and culture. As with any discipline, technology has also revolutionized tourism with Internet. This interconnected network has changed the way of registration in a hotel, mode of transportation and even, it has let us virtually move to place what we would like to visit. Definitely, “when modes of transportation evolve, technology and living conditions all over the world, tourism changes” (Jorge Bonilla, 2013, p.35).

Recently, the volume of data has experimented a considerable growth because of its application in generating knowledge and determination in making decisions. Mainly, the idea is that a large majority of enterprises and organizations design their own successful strategy to augur a brighter future (Octavio Lerena, 2019). To get it, it is necessary to foresee an expert system, that is, an intelligent information system composed by two modules: a base of knowledge and a rules interpreter. The base of knowledge contains the information requested of a concrete problem, meanwhile, the rules interpreter overcomes this problem by offering answers and orienting user to solution (Bohanec, M. et al., 1983). For further details, it is better to see how theory is applied to practice.

The project is realised by members of University Community of Colima (México). It consists of evaluating tourist destinations via data science technology. Based on those feeling provoked by previous tourists, its main objective is proportioning information to new tourist when they choose a touristic destine (Amaya Molinar C. M et al., 2017). The first step will be selecting the factors which contribute to offer an outcome. Subsequently, through the analyses of text and social media and from the implementation of processes of learning machine as Deep Learning, needed information will be compiled to create a structure or prediction model (Itelligent, 2017). It is right here when two essential terms related to data science appear: Data Mining and Big Data. Data Mining is referring to: “By means of using various tools and algorithmics techniques, data mining looks for patterns of hidden interest with the objective of predicting future situations with a certain degree of probability (Ana M. Polo, 2016, P.3). The definition of Big Data says that: “The technology Big Data is capable of capturing, storing, operating, and processing quickly and easily large volumes of data by gaining from them. Fundamentally, it is focused on predictive analyses and identifying trends by using different techniques, for example data mining. With the definition of models and the use of diver technologies, the study promotes converting data in a valuable asset” (Thais Balagueró, 2017, párr. 10). Both procedures complement each other to register trends and find “golden data”. After gathering all possible information, the study tries to analyse valuations, attitudes, and feelings of tourists to classify the recollected data by means of a process denominated as feelings mining. Its objective is extracting subjective data by applying NLP (Ana M. Polo, 2016, 17). After following this methodology, the academic research offers positive outcomes because data science helps to identify services, establishments, and agents what, respectively, harm and favour the imagen of a tourist destine to be chosen. In general terms, the management of mass data and the development of decision support systems have provided the possibility of benefitting big quantities of data from Internet to bring a raft of benefits. As well as touristic sector, other areas such as developers outlined in data science. For instance, the system Statihouse is used to qualify, in a statistic way, property offers and, also to prognostic the price. As a result, we can underline another successful case in the application of data science technology (J.I. Pérez Rave, 2018).

### Natural Language Processing in Spanish Language
Fifties can be considered the point of departure for natural processing language. The stage after was marked by Alan Turing, who questioned the intelligibility of machine. As well as Noam Chomsky, who developed its generative grammatic to formalize grammatical rules (Spanish Society for Natural Language Processing, 2020). From that moment, different associations and societies were consolidated. They were focused on exploring the evolution and growth of NLP as Mexican Association for Natural Language Processing. This entity is composed by twelve investigation groups that coordinate and share views. Some of them are the Investigation in Computation Centre (CIC-IPN) and the Institute of Investigation in Applied Mathematics and Systems (IIMAS – UNAM) (AMPLN, 2009). As with the Spanish Society for Natural Processing Language, which was created with the aim of promoting activities or giving information related to NLP: information about congresses, publications, job offers and investigation groups (SEPLN, 2021). Apart from institutions, there are some academic works that associate NLP and Spanish language. Looking for scientific databases, there are some academic works oriented to NLP. The first one is entitled “Applications of Natural Language Processing”, developed by M. Beatriz, professor at National Polytechnic School of Quito (Equator) and J. M. Gómez, research professor at University of Alicante. The objective is contributing to understand texts in which NLP techniques are applied (M.B., & Gómez, J.M., 2013). Jesús Vilares, a member of the department of Computer Science and Information Technologies, highlights the presence and domine of other languages as English. Furthermore, in 2005, he writes an article entitled “Applications of Natural Language Processing”, in which it is mentioned the background position of Spanish language in the study of the viability of NLP application in information retrieval systems of Spanish documents. Other studies are focused on improving present techniques such as automatic translation of texts and documents classification. This is possible due to the implementation of new tools, particularly, a syntactic and morphological analyser. This information has been gathered by the article “NLPT – Suite: Suite for Natural Language Processing in Spanish”. It was prepared by many constituents of Cuban corporations, in particular Santiago of Cuba: Pattern Recognition Studies and Data Mining Centre, University of Orient. The Enterprise of Applications Development, Technologies and Systems, and Applied Linguistics Centre (Ramírez-Cruz et al., 2010). 

### What is the role of a data scientist?
From the beginning of 2020, 44 zettabytes of data are managed in the world, that is the same thing as saying that the number of bytes in the universe was forty time greater that the number of observable stars. The problem comes with data management. That is the reason why we start talking about data scientist, who conventional wisdom identifies as: “A statistic who works in San Francisco” (Xataka, 2020).

In 2006, Jonathan Goldman began working in the social network LinkedIn. He started creating theories, new patterns, and models, and he also explored the connections between people. Hence, J. Goldman speculated that there will be new possibilities on the horizon. One of his ideas was the suggestion between profiles, what means to incentivize people meets other people and with whom it shared knowledges, education, formation centres or abilities. In that moment, Goldman became a reference of data scientist. However, to talk about data scientist is unviable without knowing one of the most powerful tools of data science, dataset. A dataset is defined as: “group information, published or selected by an only one reference and available to access and download in several formats” (W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary, 2020). On the list that Allen Institute for AI makes public about recent datasets, we would like to underscore the following: ATOMIC 2020, an atlas of reasoning of daily common sense organized by textual descriptions. Scruples, a corpus and reference point to predict ethical trials of communities about real life anecdotes. RuleTaker, a dataset used to teach transformers to reason. And GenericsKB, a repository with a big base of knowledge about generics sentences. As we mentioned before, datasets should be always revised by a data scientist. At times, the worse enemy of data scientists is not having an appropriate dataset. Others, data are sorely lacking to get conclusions. And, on other occasions, dataset is of poor quality. To this should be added the deficiency of languages variety in datasets design because in almost all cases datasets are redacted in English. This interminable list, where newest datasets appear, is another proof of the marginalisation of Spanish language. For this reason, we need to rethink of: ¿Why do they admit the subjugation of science and universal use of data? And ¿Is manipulated, remote-controlled and condemned a data scientist?

According to Open Group industry, a data scientist cooperates with business leaders to resolve problems by means of comprehension, preparation, and data analyses. In this way, a data scientist could predict emerging trends and offer recommendation with the objective of optimizing commercial outcomes. Therefore, Open Group details certain essential abilities that a data scientist should have to augur well for the future. Some of these qualities are business acumen to understand a problem and seeking a solution. Apart from these attributes, a person dedicated to data science should deal with learning machine to manage predictions (Álvarez y Coll-Serrano, 2018).
