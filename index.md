### Abstract

This study analyses the state of data science and AI in Spanish language. The motivation is driven by our previous project: https://doi.org/10.21428/39829d0b.d871fa5c - “The art of Artificial Intelligence from a lexical perspective”. The search for information about AI in Spanish language was a failure, so it must rely on English language. This study is divided into two interlinked parts: the first one exposes what data science is, the benefits produced, and the education that a data scientist should have. Therefore, a relation of data science and AI with Spanish language. Questions are raised about how the training of data scientist in Spain is, and the analysis of diagrams, which shows the percentage of Spanish and English academic articles. Moreover, there are many contributions of members and representatives of Latin American Languages Academies. They comment on the lack of AI glossary written in Spanish language. The study of art provides results that indicate the absence of involvement of Spanish with AI and all the subareas, which consequently adversely affect to the education of future professionals. Key words: AI, data science, Spanish language and education.

Key words: AI, data science, Spanish language and education. 

### Introduction
### What is known?
“The idea that all change should be sweet, slow and stable does not sprout from rocks. It represented a common cultural bias, that is, an answer from the liberalism of nineteenth century for a world in revolution […].” Those words were used by the palaeontologist Stephen J. Gould to describe the term “gradualism”. This concept directly addresses the revolution of planet because of the development of TICs and the progress of new educational areas as artificial intelligence (Manuel Castell, 1999, p.1). Generally, when we refer to AI, a significant percentage of population has a wrong idea of what it is because AI is not refer to machines that do the tedious work which human being does not carry out. Artificial intelligence is much more (IT Digital Media Group, 2017). There are many branches of knowledge in AI that help us daily, for instance, data science enables us to identify the hidden relationships between variables with the aim of stablishing and creating different versions and predictive classifications (R.A. Salas Rueda, 2019) (R.D. Salas Rueda, 2019). For more information, see also the next example. The acronym “MENA” is used in Spain to denominate unaccompanied foreign minors (BBC News, 2019). However, thanks to data mining technique (an area of data science), it has been found that: “This abbreviature evokes a concerned, criminalized and moralist discourse from an adult centric and nationalist perspective (Scientific journal of Comunication and Education: Comunicar, 2021).
